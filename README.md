#### Simple Lisk payout script focused on multi delegate pools

This script is forked from [yet-another-lisk-pool](https://github.com/alepop/yet-another-lisk-pool) from Alepop delegate and adapted for pools payouts.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/nerdvibe/lisk-happy-voter.git
    cd ./lisk-happy-voter
    yarn

## Configuration
Rename `example.config.json` to `config.json` and fill it with your settings.

```json
{
    "node": "https://testnet.lisk.io",
    "port": "443",
    "isTestnet": true,
    "epochPoolTime": 1593738603,
    "sharedPercent": 20,
    "sharingDelegates": 3,
    "minPayout": 1,
    "referenceDelegatePubKey":
    "the delegate where the blocks will be counted",
    "poolMembers": [
        "pubKey for each delegate in the pool, used to get the voters",
        "pubKey for each delegate in the pool, used to get the voters",
    ],
    "poolAddresses": [
        "address for each delegate in the pool, blacklisted from reward",
        "address for each delegate in the pool, blacklisted from reward",
        "address for each delegate in the pool, blacklisted from reward"
    ]
}
```

where:
 - `epochPoolTime` is the first time the pool has been created in unix timestamp
 - `sharingDelegates` is the number of delegates sharing the rewards in the group.
  
## Usage

Use this commands:


```js
yarn get:payouts // will calculate rewards and save it to the ./data/balance.json file

yarn sign:transactions -- "secret" "secondSecret" // will sign transaction and save it to the ./data/payouts.json file

yarn broadcast:transactions // Broadcast transactions to the network


// in case you want to know how much is the payout after you generated

yarn help:get-pending
```
